W25 STATS 250 –   Introduction to Statistics and   Data Analysis
SECTION A: COURSE OVERVIEW
A1 Course   Description
Stats   250   is   a one-term, algebra-based   introductory statistics course   that   introduces   students   to   the   investigative   process   of statistics so they   may   become critical consumers   of statistical   results   and   claims.   Students   will   learn   to   graphically   and   numerically   summarize data and   use their   understanding of variability to   make   inferences   from   a   sample   to   its   associated   population.
A2   Learning Objectives
After   taking   Stats   250 you   will   be   able   to:
●          Think   critically   about   quantitative   information   in   your   everyday   life,   including   asking   questions   about   and   evaluating   the   origins   of data, analysis   of data, and   interpretations   and   real-world   decisions   based   on   data.
●          Translate   research   questions   into   appropriate   statistical   procedures   and   use   data   to   address   those   questions.
●             Understand that variability   is a   natural   part of the   scientific   process   and   how   variability   affects   data   that   we   analyze   in   everyday   life.
●             Effectively communicate statistical   ideas to   a   non-statistical audience.
●             Use a statistical   programming   software   R via   RStudio to   perform   basic   data   analysis   and   use   data   to   investigate   scientific   questions.
A4   Required   Resources
Required   1: STATS 250 Winter 25   Interactive   Course   Pack: We   do   not   require   students   to   purchase   a   publisher-developed   textbook   but   do   require students to always   bring to class   a   course   pack   we   have   written   to   integrate   into   lecture   meetings.   This   class moves   quickly and students sometimes   express   difficulty copying   down   relevant   information   from   scratch. The   course   pack provides   partially filled-in   notes, activities, examples, and   supplemental   readings,   allowing   students to   focus   only   on   writing   the   most   important concepts.   Students   must   bring the course   pack to class.   We   provide   two   options   for   students:
1.             Hardcopy   ($33.22): We   work   with   a   publisher   to   print   the   entire   course   pack   at   a   discounted   price,   cheaper   than   if    students   elected to   print out the course   pack themselves. You   can   purchase the   course   pack   and   have   it   shipped   to   a   street   address   of   your   choosing   atthis   link.
2.             Digital: Students with   access to a tablet   and   stylus   can   elect   to   download   a   PDF   of   the   full   course   pack   from   our   class   Canvas   page and   annotate the digital course   pack with   a   PDF   editor   of their   choosing.
Required 2: Gradescope   ($0 free): All course-related   assignments   are   submitted,   evaluated,   and   returned to   students   through
Gradescope. To create your Gradescope   account for   this   course,   visit   the   course   Canvas   site   and   click   on   the `Gradescope`   link   from the   left-hand   navigation   bar. Thereafter, you’ll   be auto-enrolled   in our course   sites   (no join   code   needed).
Required   3:   Posit.Cloud   Account   ($0 free)   Refer   to   the   Lab   0   assignment   on   Gradescope   for   instructions   on   creating   an            RStudio
Cloud   account. You   can   only   create an   account on the Stats   250   Posit.Cloud   workspace   by following   the   steps   outlined   in   Lab   0.

5.2   Disability   Statement
The   University   of   Michigan   recognizes   disability   as an   integral   part of diversity   and   is   committed to   creating an   inclusive   and
equitable educational environment for students with   disabilities.   Students   who   are   experiencing   a   disability-related   barrier   should
contact   Services   for   Students   with   Disabilities   (SSD)https://ssd.umich.edu/;   734-763-3000   or   [email   protected].   For   students
who are connected with SSD,   accommodation   requests   can   be   made   in Accommodate,   a   new   platform   recently   adopted   on   campus.      If   you   have   just   started   working   with   SSD   and   plan   to   get   documentation,   please   email   [email   protected]   as   soon   as   possible.
Due to the time   necessary for   instructional staff to   make appropriate   arrangements to   ensure   accommodations   are   applied,   3   weeks   in   advance   notice of testing accommodations   is   requested.   If testing accommodations   are   not   received   by the   course   instructors
within   14 days   of an exam, we   cannot guarantee   those   accommodations   can   be   facilitated.
In   rare cases, we acknowledge the   need for   a testing   accommodation   may   arise   within   a   shorter   turnaround   time   (example:   a
broken wrist).   In these cases, the student should   contact   the   SSD   office   and   work   with   their   instructor   to   determine   what   is   possible,   knowing that   not all accommodations   can   be   provided on   short   notice.If you   have any questions or concerns,   please   contact   your   SSD   Coordinator   or visit   SSD’s   Current   Student   webpage.   SSD   considers   aspects   of the course design, course   learning objects,   and the   individual   academic   and   course   barriers   experienced   by   the   student.   Further conversation with SSD,   instructors, and the   student   may   be   warranted   to   ensure   an   accessible   course   experience.
A6   Engaging with the   Material
●          Attend   Lectures   Regularly:   Lectures   introduce   key   concepts   essential   for   your   understanding   of   the   course.   Here   are   a   list   of study strategies that will   help you succeed   in   the   learning   process:
o    Follow along with the   interactive   lecture   notes:   Use the   provided   notes   during   lectures   to   actively   engage   with   the   material. The   notes   are designed to   keep you on tract   with   the   fast   pace   of the   class.
o    Participate   in the   “Try   It” examples:   Engage with   classmates to   work   through   the   “Try   It”   examples   scattered   throughout the   lectures.    These exercises   reinforce your   learning and   provide   real-time   practice.
o    Summarize   key ideas: At the   end of   each   lecture,   you   will   find   a   space   to   summarize   the   key   ideas   covered.   Devote   a few   minutes soon   after the   lecture to   reflect on these   key   concepts   and jot   down   any   questions   you   still   have.
You   can   post your questions   on   Piazza or visit office   hours to   get   clarifications.   One   of   the   challenges   in   this   course   is   learning   how to   learn   effectively   and   discovering study techniques that work   best for you.      Regularly   engaging
with these   prompts will   help you   build skills while   reinforcing the   material.
●             Weekly   Labs:   Labs   are designed   to   help you   apply   concepts   learned   in   lecture to   real-world   data   using   R. GSIs   will   guide you   through   analyzing   real-world   data sets   in   R, focusing on   applying statistical   methods   and   interpreting   results. Your first   lab            will   meet   the   week   of   January   27.
o    Preparing for   Lab:   Labs   assume you   have attended   lectures,   as they   focus   on   application   and   analysis   rather   than   re-teaching   lecture content. The   key to getting the   most   out   of   lab   is   to   come   prepared   by   reviewing   the   relevant   lecture   material   beforehand.
●          Ask   Questions   and   Contribute   to   Discussion:   There   are   several   opportunities   to   ask   questions   and   clarify   your
understanding, whether during   lectures,   in   labs,   during office   hours, or   on   Piazza.      Actively   participating   by   asking   questions   and   engaging   in   discussion with your   peers   is   key to   deepening your   understanding of the   material.
A7 Tips for Succeeding in   Stats   250
The full   instructional team   is   here to   help you   navigate the course and   successfully   complete   it.      Some   helpful tips:
●             Set a general study schedule for   each   week.   It’s   easier   to   block   off time   for   each   class   than   to juggle   your   work   without   a   general   plan.
●             Keep   up with   lectures.   Do   not substitute   labs for   lectures.   Labs   are   meant   to   provide   practice   with   using   some features   of   R   to visualize and   analyze   real data.   Lab   instructors will   assume students   are   keeping   up   with   lecture   material   prior   to attending   lab.
●             Start your   homework early   and   ask questions when you   have   them.   Ask   questions   when   you   have   them.
●             Participate   in   class   by   asking and/or answering questions   during   lectures,   lab   meetings,   office   hours,   or   through   piazza.
Contact   members   of the   instructional team   (GSI and   lecture   instructors   using email)   if you   are   having difficulties   (earlier,   rather than   later).
SECTION   B: GRADING   POLICIESYour   overall   grade   in   Stats   250   is   determined   by   the   three   components:   (1)   Exams   and   Lecture   Assignments,   worth   50%   of   your overall   course   grade;   (2) Weekly   Lab   Assignments   and   Case   studies   Write-Ups,   worth   40%   of   your   overall   course   grade;   and   (3)      Weekly   Homework Assignments, worth   10% of your overall course   grade.
B1   Exams and   Lecture Work: 50% of your overall   course grade.
Together,   exams   and   lecture work total 50% of your   overall   course grade.   Students   can   choose   between   two   options   for   precisely            how this contribution   is tabulated. The ‘Traditional’ approach weights   exams   at   50%   and   lecture   work   at   0%; the   ‘Active’   approach   weights   exams   at   40% and   lecture   work   at   10%.
1.1   Exam   Information
Exam   dates   and   times   are   common   across   all   lecture   sections;   100,   200,   300, and   400.   You   will   have   80   minutes   to   complete   exams which   are   proctored   in-person, on   paper,   in   a closed-notes format. Calculators   are   permitted,   but   not   required   on   exams.   NOTE:   If
you are entitled to extended time   or   reduced   distraction   testing   environments,   please   see   our   policy   on   submitting   accommodations   in   section   5.2, above. You   must   take   both   Exam   01   and   Exam   02 to   complete   the   class.
Exam   01 – Tuesday,   February   25th
Exam   01 covers   lectures   01 –   11,   proctored   at   6:00   PM   on   February   25th.   Students   can   bring   a   calculator   if   they   would   like   to   but   will not   need   one to   be successful on the test.  代 写W25 STATS 250 – Introduction to Statistics and Data AnalysisMatlab
代做程序编程语言 Roughly one   week   before   the   exam,   the   instructional   team   will   post   a   practice   exam   and         review   packet students   can   use to assist   in studying. Additionally, the   lab just   prior   to   the   exam   will   be   used   as   an   additional   review         session.
Exam   02 -- Thursday, April   24th
Exam   02 covers   lectures   12-24. Although   this   exam   is   technically   non-cumulative,   many   concepts   in   STATS   250   do   build   off   one
another.   Like   Exam   01, this   is   a   closed   note,   pen-and-paper   exam,   proctored   at   7:30   PM   on   April   24th.   Review   materials   will   be
provided   roughly one week   prior to   Exam 02.   [NOTE: Although the   Registrar   allocates   two   hours   for final   exam   proctoring   sessions,   Exam   02   is   only   80   minutes   long, just   like   Exam   01.]
1.2   Lecture   Approach   Options
Here’s   how   it works: the semester   is   divided   into two   blocks   of   lectures.    At the   start   of   each   block,   students   will   be   asked to   choose   between two options   outlined   below:
●             Option   01: Traditional   Lecture
o    Attendance:   Not   required. Students   can   keep   up with the   lecture   material   by   attending   lectures   or   reviewing   recordings.
o    Lecture work:   Not   required.   Lecture   pre-work and   group   work   are   not   required.
o    Keep   up with   material: Attend   lecture   in   person   or watch   the   recording   at   your   convenience.   Keep   in   mind   that
students should   be caught   up with   lecture-related content before   beginning   any   lab   or   HW   assignments   due   for   a   given   week.   Plan accordingly!
o      Grading   Impact:   Exams   are   more   heavily   weighted   (each   exam   is   25% of   your   overall   grade).
●             Option   02: Active   Learning   Lecture
o    Attendance:   Required   in   person. Students   can   keep   up with the   lecture   material   by   attending   lectures   and   accessing   lecture   recordings.
o    Lecture work:   Required. Students   complete two   low-stakes   assignments   associated   with   each   lecture.
.                Prework Assignments: Students complete a   brief   5-10   minute   assignment   before   each   lecture. These
assignments   are designed to familiarize students with   key   ideas   in   an   upcoming   class   meeting   or to   review   key   ideas from   a   recent   one.
.                Group   Work   Assignments:   During   the   last   30   minutes   of   each   lecture   meeting, students   will   work   with   2-3   of
their   peers   (i.e.,   in   teams   of   up   to   4) to   complete   and   submit   a   set   of   exercises   by   the   end   of   each   lecture.
These exercises   are designed to give students   immediate   practice   with   concepts   and   skills   learned   during   a   lecture   meeting.
o    Graduate student   instructors and   undergraduate   instructional assistants   will   be   present   in   lectures   to   help   facilitate   group work.
o    Lecture work   (pre-work and   group   work)   provides   low-stakes   opportunities   for   students to   practice   recent   content;   these assignments contribute to the overall   course   grade.
o      Grading   Impact:   Exams   are   weighted   less   heavily   (each   exam   is   20% of   your   overall   grade)   and   lecture   work assignments   are   factored   into   your   overall   grade   (1%   prework   per   block; 4% group   work   per   block).
1.3 Choosing   your   approach
Students will   be asked to choose   between these two   options   twice   during   the   semester.   Here's   how   the   decision   will   be   factored   into the overall   course grade:
●             Block   01: January   22 –   March   11   (11   lectures) -   Decide   between   option   01   and   option   02   by   Thursday, January   16   at   8   pm (see Gradescope to   select)
o      If   option   01   (traditional   lecture)   is   selected:
.                Lecture   pre-work   and   group   work   for   block   01   will   be   worth   0%   of   your   overall   course   grade .                Exam   01 will   be   worth   25% of   your   overall   course   grade
o      If   option   02   (active   lecture)   is   selected:
.                Lecture   pre-work   for   block   01 will   be   worth   1%   of   your   overall   course   grade,   and   group   work   for   block   01
will   be worth 4% of your   overall   course grade
.                Exam   01 will   be   worth   20% of   your   overall   course   grade
Note: After   Thursday, January   16, the   lecture   format   option   for   block   01 will   be   set   and   cannot   be   changed.   If   no   option   is             selected   by January   16, then option 01   (traditional approach) will   be   used   as   the   default   option   (this   applies   to   all   waitlisted   students).
●             Block   02:   March   12 – April   17   (11   lectures) -   Decide   between   option   01   and   option   02   by   Tuesday,   March   11   at   8   pm   (see Gradescope to select)
o      If   option   01   (traditional   lecture)   is   selected:
.                Lecture   pre-work   and   group   work   for   block   02   will   be   worth   0%   of   your   overall   course   grade .                Exam   02 will   be   worth   25% of   your   overall   course   grade
o      If   option   02   (active   lecture)   is   selected:
.                Lecture   pre-work   for   block   02 will   be   worth   1%   of   your   overall   grade,   and   group   work   for   block   02   will   be worth   5% of your overall   course   grade
.                Exam   02 will   be   worth   20% of   your   overall   course   gradeNote: After   Tuesday,   March   11, the   lecture   format   option   for   block   02   will   be   set   and   cannot   be   changed.   If   no   option   is selected   by   March   11, then   option   01   (traditional   approach) will   be   used   as   the   default   option   (not   the   block   01   lecture format option)
B2   Labs and Case Studies: 40% of your   overall   course   grade.
2.1 Overview of   Labs and Case   Studies:   Exploring   Real   Data with   R
During   lab, we will delve   into the exciting   world   of   data   analysis   using   R,   a   powerful tool   for   statistical   computing   and   graphics.
These   lab sessions   are designed to complement   and   enhance your   understanding   of the   lecture   material,   offering   you   hands-on
experience with   real-world   data and   practical applications.    While   lab attendance   is   not   mandatory,   we   strongly   encourage   you   to   actively   participate   in   lab   discussions.    Attending   labs will enhance your grasp of the   material   and   offer   practical   insights   that
contribute to your overall   success   in the course.   Your   first   lab   will   meet   the   week   of January   27th.
2.2   Expectations for   Lab   PreparationTo   make the   most of your   lab session,   it   is   essential to come   prepared.   Keeping   up   to   date   with   the   lecture   material   is   a   vital   part   of   effective   lab   preparation.    The   lab   assignments will   build   upon concepts   discussed   in   lectures, and your familiarity   with   these   topics   will enable you to fully engage   in the   lab   activities   and   discussions.
2.3   Purpose   of   Lab   Assignments
Our   lab   assignments   are carefully   designed to   provide you with opportunities to   apply   concepts   covered   in   lectures   to   real   data         scenarios.    By   engaging   in these   lab   activities, you will   strengthen your   analytical   skills,   gain   proficiency   in   R,   and   develop   deeper   comprehension of the subject   matter, all while gaining   valuable   skills   that   can   be   applied   to   future   research   or   professional
endeavors.Note: All   lab   assignments   are submitted   via   Gradescope.   It   is   incumbent   upon students to verify they   have   uploaded the   intended         file   in the correct format   before the stated   deadline.   Leniency will   not   be   provided   to   students   who   mistakenly   upload   an   incorrect   or corrupted file and then   request a   re-evaluation   after   an   assignment   deadline.   Submissions   will   not   be   accepted   via   email   under         any circumstances,   barring explicit directions from   a   member   of the   instructional team.
2.4   Lab   Options
The course   includes six   labs   leading to three   major case   study   assignments.   Like   with   lecture   participation,   you   can   elect   how you
would   like your   lab work to   be evaluated. You can   choose   between   two   lab   options,   labeled   the Traditional   Lab   and   Active   Lab
options. The Traditional   Lab option   benefits from   increased flexibility when   it   comes to   attending   in-person   lab   meetings;   the   Active   Lab   option   benefits from the   option to work together and   submit   in   pairs. The   options   also   differ   in   terms   of   how   lab   and   case   study      submissions are weighted.
Lab   option   01: Traditional   Lab
-                Attendance:   Not   required.   Work   at your   own   pace   by   watching   lab   videos   or   attending   lab   meetings   in   person.
-                     Grade   impact:
-                   Lab   work: 5%   of   overall   course   grade.
-                     Case   Study   01: 8%   of   overall   course   grade.
-                     Case   Study   02:   12% of   overall   course   grade.
-                     Case   Study   03:   15% of   overall   course   grade.
-                Work   submission:   all   lab   and   case   study   assignments   must   be   submitted   individually.
-                Commitment:   This   decision   is   independent   of the   lecture   format   you   select.      Students   will   need   to   make   a   lab   format         commitment   by Thursday, January 30th at 8   pm   (see Gradescope to   make   a   selection).      Once   the   lab   format   selection   is   made, you cannot switch to the other   lab   option.   Your   selection   applies   for   the   entire   semester.
Lab   option   02:    Active   Lab
-                Attendance:   Required   in   person.*   (see   note   below)
-                     Grade   impact:
-                   Lab   work:   10% of   overall   course   grade.
-                     Case   Study   01: 7%   of   overall   course   grade.
-                     Case   Study   02:   10% of   overall   course   grade.
-                     Case   Study   03:   13% of   overall   course   grade.
-                Work   submission:   lab   and   case   study   assignments   can   be   submitted   in   pairs.   Paired   case   study   submissions   (but   not   labs) are   eligible   for   +2   bonus   points.
-                Commitment:   This   decision   is   independent   of the   lecture   format   you   select.   Students   will   need   to   make   a   lab   format
commitment   by Thursday, January 30th at 8   pm   (see Gradescope to   make   a   selection).   Once   the   lab   format   selection   is   made, you cannot switch to the   other   lab   option.    Your   selection   applies   for   the   entire   semester.
*Note that,   in addition to   1 guaranteed   drop throughout the semester,   we   will   be   implementing   the   following   attendance   policy for students who   have selected the Active   Lab   approach:
Active   Lab students   are afforded   one excused   absence   per semester.   If   a   student   cannot   attend   lab   in   a   given   week,   they   are welcome to complete and submit the   associated   lab   assignment   outside   of their   lab   for   full   credit   evaluation.   Any
additional   lab   absences will   result   in   a   10%   penalty on   lab/case study assignments   submitted that   week.
As   an   example: There are 8   required   lab   meetings Active   Lab students   must   attend   this   term.   Suppose   an   Active   Lab   student   misses two of these   lab   meetings,   but still completes   and   submits the   associated   lab   assignments. The   first   will   be   evaluated   for full credit,   but the second will   be   evaluated with   a   10%   penalty.   Then,   at   the   end   of the   semester,   the   guaranteed   drop will   be applied to the   lowest score across   all   lab   assignments   submitted   across the   entire   semester.
Late submissions for   lab assignments: We offer   a   1-hour   late   submission   window for   all   lab   assignments   without   any   penalty.   No   submissions are accepted after this   1-hour   extension. Students   are   responsible   for   ensuring   they   have   uploaded   the   intended   file   in   the correct format   before the   deadline.
Late submissions for case study   reports: We   offer   a   1-hour   late   submission   window for   all   case   study   assignments   without   any   penalty. Thereafter, we   offer   an   additional   23-hour   late   submission   window   at   a   10%   penalty   to   the   student’s   overall   grade   (e.g.,   a   case study that   is submitted   3   hours   late cannot earn   above   90%).   Students   are   responsible   for   ensuring   they   have   uploaded   the   intended file   in the correct format   before the   deadline.
